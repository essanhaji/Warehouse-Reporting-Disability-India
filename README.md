# Database Connection and project importation

It's better to use this configuration below because my database configuration was like this, to import the project and to run jobs easy.
Database connection :

* user : root
* password : root

When you import the project in Tatend Studio run job that has name "all_jobs.job" , Weâ€™ve creat this global job to help us organize the sequence of execution of our elementary jobs.
